=== User Stories ===

- The user is greeted with a page asking them to supply a name for their character
- Once a name is supplied, the game can begin
- The user is tasked with keeping their character alive
- There are 3 buttons that control various stats of the character
- The user is tasked with pressing these buttons to maintain a specific range of values
- If the user allows the characterâ€™s values to exceed the allotted range, the character will die
- If the user maintains the value range necessary for survival, after a time the character will evolve
- There are 5 primary stages of evolution, 3 secret branches, and one special end game evolution
- The user will receive any of 6 different game over screens depending on the way they play
- The user is given the option to restart at game over or simply accept the outcome of their play-through

=== Nature of the Project ===

This project was, at its core, a Tamagotchi knockoff. In my interpretation of the classic Tamagotchi experience, I created a faster paced and more competitive version to suit my personal taste. I especially enjoy uncovering new things I didn't know about games after playing them for a while, and that comes through clearly in this project.

=== Approach ===

My approach was basically to start with the simplest design I could and build as much of the functionality as I could around that design. Once the functionality began to outgrow the design, I would add to the design, which would then enable further functionality. This development cycle took me from typing out the basics of the game object all the way to putting the final touches on the various game over states of the game. I chose to use jQuery and Bootstrap because I know these technologies are commonplace and experience in them will no doubt serve me well in the rest of this course and far beyond. 

=== Unsolved Problems ===

The only real unsolved problem of this project was mirroring the image based on movement direction. That problem proved quite substantial as a result of the way I built out the animation code, but ultimately it was a functionality that I decided was insignificant compared to other things I could implement in the time necessary to implement the mirroring.

=== Project Roadmap ===

This was used for planning ideas as well as structuring my use of time throughout the project
